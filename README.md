Disney Flashcard-Generator

Overview  In this week's assignment, you will create the backend for a basic flashcard application. 

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards. Basic flashcards, which have a front ("What is the name of Lilo's Sister from Lilo and Stitch?"), and a back ("Nani"). 

Cloze-Deleted flashcards, which present partial text ("... is the name of Sally's motel in Cars."), and the full text when the user requests it ("The Cozy Cone is the name of Sally's motel in Cars.") Cloze Deletions  A cloze deletion is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed.
